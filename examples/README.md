# ZeoCore examples

Fifteen runnable scripts. Every one of them runs as-is — none are
illustrative fragments, and none require you to fill in a placeholder before
they do something.

```bash
python examples/<name>.py
```

Run them **from the repository root**: several write scratch files relative
to the current working directory, and `zeo_core.core.fs` sandboxes file
access to the project root by default.

This page is a catalog. If you are looking for the API these scripts use,
see [docs/reference/api.md](../docs/reference/api.md); for prose
walkthroughs, see [GET-STARTED.md](../GET-STARTED.md) and
[docs/README.md](../docs/README.md).

---

## Before you start

**Python 3.13+ and ZeoCore installed.** From a clone:

```bash
pip install -e .            # base install: the eight offline examples below
pip install -e ".[all]"     # every integration extra
pip install -e ".[http]"    # single extras, as needed
```

**Extras.** Seven scripts need an optional extra. Each one says so in its
own module docstring, and the groups below list them.

**Credentials.** Scripts that need a secret read it from the process
environment — never from a config file. Copy [`.env.example`](../.env.example)
to `.env`, fill in real values, and load it however your tooling prefers:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python examples/notion_usage.py
```

**Nothing here is destructive to your machine.** Scripts that need scratch
space use either the system temp directory or a `./tmp_*_example/` folder
that they delete on exit. The two that write to a real external account
(Notion, Google Calendar) create objects in *your* workspace — Calendar
deletes its demo event afterwards; Notion leaves the page it creates.

---

## Start here: the offline path

Eight scripts, in learning order. They need **only the base install** — no
extras, no credentials, no network. Work through them top to bottom and you
will have seen the whole authoring surface.

### 1. [`minimal_tool.py`](minimal_tool.py) — the floor

The smallest legal tool: subclass `BaseZeoTool`, implement
`run(request, ctx)`, return a `CapabilityResult`. No mixins, no services, no
optional behavior.

```bash
python examples/minimal_tool.py
```

Builds a `ToolContext` in a temp directory (playing the runner's role),
counts words in a sentence, prints `Words: 8, Characters: 73`.

### 2. [`capability_authoring.py`](capability_authoring.py) — the canonical surface

The same idea as a function: `@capability` with an id, description,
declared effects, and one example; then `bound_capability_of()` and
`invoke_sync()`, with a `CapabilityRegistry` in between.

```bash
python examples/capability_authoring.py
```

Prints `Hello, World!` — deliberately boring output for a script whose point
is the shape of the code above it.

### 3. [`capability_guards.py`](capability_guards.py) — rejecting bad requests

A `RequestGuard` is a policy check over an already-validated request.
Pydantic checks shape; a guard checks whether the request should be allowed
to run at all.

```bash
python examples/capability_guards.py
```

Invokes the capability twice. The good request prints its slug; the blank
one prints `guard_rejected`, `ZEO_CAP_GUARD_REJECTED`, and
`rejected has data: False` — the handler body never ran.

### 4. [`tool_to_capability.py`](tool_to_capability.py) — bridging the two styles

`tool_to_capability()` adapts a `BaseZeoTool` class into a
`BoundCapability` by reading the class's own `run()` type hints, so a class
tool gains registry, manifest, and adapter support without being rewritten.

```bash
python examples/tool_to_capability.py
```

Calls the same tool both ways — `tool.run()` directly and `invoke_sync()`
through the adapter — prints matching results, the canonical id
`demo.word_count@1.0.0`, and a registry hit.

### 5. [`error_handling.py`](error_handling.py) — when to raise instead

`CapabilityResult` covers expected outcomes; the `ZeoError` family covers
genuinely exceptional ones. This walks the difference with three failure
modes and one success, including the `@wrap_io_errors` decorator that
converts stray builtins into typed `ZeoError` subclasses.

```bash
python examples/error_handling.py
```

Prints four labeled scenarios — missing file, invalid JSON, missing required
key, valid file — each with the exception type and its structured
`.context` dict.

### 6. [`config_usage.py`](config_usage.py) — `load_config()`'s three behaviors

The one confusing thing about configuration, made explicit: calling
`load_config()` with no argument never raises, while calling it with an
explicit path that does not exist always does.

```bash
python examples/config_usage.py
```

Prints all three paths in order: built-in defaults with no config file
anywhere, a deliberately caught `ZeoConfigurationError`, and real values
loaded from a YAML file the script writes first.

### 7. [`explicit_plugin_loading_example.py`](explicit_plugin_loading_example.py) — discovery without side effects

Importing `zeo_core.modules` loads nothing. This shows discovery (listing
without instantiating), explicit loading, and how `strict=True` differs from
`strict=False` when an id is misspelled.

```bash
python examples/explicit_plugin_loading_example.py
```

Lists the four built-in entry points (`config`, `fs`, `paths`, `prompt`),
confirms the registry is still empty after discovery, loads three plugins,
then shows strict mode refusing everything on a typo versus non-strict mode
loading what it can and reporting a warning. A few plugin-registration log
lines are printed to stderr along the way; they are expected.

### 8. [`llm_tools_usage.py`](llm_tools_usage.py) — projecting to an LLM tool list

`CapabilityManifest.from_definition()` plus `project_openai_tool()` turns a
capability into an OpenAI function tool. No API key, no network, no extra —
this is pure schema work.

```bash
python examples/llm_tools_usage.py
```

Prints the projected function name (`demo_greet_v1_0_0`), description, and
parameters — then feeds it a schema containing `not` and prints the typed
refusal, because the projection refuses unsupported keywords instead of
silently dropping them.

> `make test-docs` smoke-tests an allowlist of these credential-free
> examples against their exact expected stdout, so the offline path is
> guaranteed to keep working.

## Adapters and mixins

Intermediate. Each needs one extra, and each is about *hosting* capabilities
rather than writing them.

### [`toolkit_usage.py`](toolkit_usage.py) — mixins and graceful skip

**Extra:** `zeocore[drive]` (or `[google]`, or `[all]`) — the script imports
`GoogleDriveService` at module level, so without the extra it fails on
import rather than skipping.
**Credentials:** none. It never contacts Google.

Layers `IntegrationEnabledMixin` (service lookup from `ctx.services`) and
`LifecycleMixin` (`pre_run` / `post_run`) onto a tool that reads JSON,
computes statistics, and *optionally* uploads to Drive.

```bash
python examples/toolkit_usage.py
```

Requests the upload with no `google_drive` service wired into the context, so
the tool logs the absence and continues: `Uploaded file id: None`, then
writes the processed JSON to a temp output directory. That graceful-skip
path — a missing optional service is not an error — is the lesson.

### [`http_adapter_usage.py`](http_adapter_usage.py) — the same capability over REST

**Extra:** `zeocore[http]`.
**Credentials:** none. No server is started and no port is bound.

Binds a capability into `OperationRegistry` with
`register_capability_operation()`, builds the FastAPI app exactly as a real
server would, and drives it with `TestClient`.

```bash
python examples/http_adapter_usage.py
```

Prints three `200` responses: `/health/live`, `/ops` listing the registered
`greet` operation, and `POST /ops/greet` returning the full serialized
`CapabilityResult`. Without the extra it prints an install hint and exits 0.

### [`mcp_server_usage.py`](mcp_server_usage.py) — the same tool over MCP

**Extra:** `zeocore[mcp]`.
**Credentials:** none. The client connects to the server object in memory —
no subprocess, no network.

`register_tool()` derives an MCP tool from an ordinary `BaseZeoTool` by
reading its `run()` type hint. The tool class here is identical to
`minimal_tool.py`'s: nothing about a tool changes to make it MCP-reachable.

```bash
python examples/mcp_server_usage.py
```

Registers the tool, creates the server, lists `['word_count']` through the
real MCP SDK client, calls it, and prints the JSON result. Without the extra
it raises `ImportError` with an install hint — the adapter's stub, working as
designed.

---

## Integrations

The most advanced group: real external tools and real accounts. Each script
checks its precondition first and **skips gracefully** rather than crashing,
so all four are safe to run before you have set anything up.

### [`jupytext_usage.py`](jupytext_usage.py) — script ↔ notebook round trip

**Extra:** `zeocore[jupytext]`.
**Credentials:** none. Fully local.

```bash
python examples/jupytext_usage.py
```

Writes a percent-format `.py` into `./tmp_jupytext_example/`, converts it to
`.ipynb`, converts it back, and confirms the round trip preserved the
function. The scratch directory is deleted on exit. Without the extra, the
integration's `initialize()` returns a failure result and the script prints
`jupytext module is not installed` instead of crashing.

### [`ffmpeg_usage.py`](ffmpeg_usage.py) — probe, transcode, thumbnail

**Extra:** `zeocore[ffmpeg]`.
**External tool:** a real `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` on `PATH` (`brew install ffmpeg`,
`apt install ffmpeg`), or resolvable through `ffmpeg-zeo`'s own download
mechanism.

```bash
python examples/ffmpeg_usage.py
```

Generates a one-second synthetic test video with ffmpeg's `lavfi` source (no
media file needed), probes it, transcodes to H.264, writes a thumbnail, and
prints the integration's render metrics. Expect ffmpeg's own verbose output
on stderr mixed in — that is ffmpeg talking, not an error. Missing binary:
prints a skip message. Missing extra: `initialize()` fails with an install
hint.

### [`notion_usage.py`](notion_usage.py) — real read and write

**Extra:** `zeocore[notion]`.
**Credentials:** `NOTION_TOKEN` — an integration token from
<https://www.notion.so/my-integrations>, **shared with at least one page**
from Notion's UI (creating the token is not enough; Notion's model requires
explicitly sharing each page or database with it).

```bash
python examples/notion_usage.py                       # skips, shows the call shapes
NOTION_TOKEN=secret_xxx python examples/notion_usage.py   # live
```

Without the token: prints a skip notice and the exact calling shapes for
`search`, `get_page`, `get_database`, `query_database`, and `create_page`.
With it: writes a minimal config file into `./tmp_notion_example/` (the
Notion config provider requires *a* config file to exist), searches your
workspace, then creates a child page under the first shared page and appends
a paragraph block to it. The scratch directory is removed; **the created page
is not** — delete it in Notion when you are done.

### [`calendar_usage.py`](calendar_usage.py) — OAuth, read and write

**Extra:** `zeocore[calendar]` (or `[google]`) — imported at module level, so
without it the script fails on import.
**Credentials:** `ZEO_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRETS`, pointing at an OAuth
client-secrets JSON file (Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services →
Credentials → OAuth client ID → *Desktop app*, with the Calendar API enabled
on that project). There is no single-token shortcut here, unlike Notion.

```bash
python examples/calendar_usage.py                     # skips, shows the call shapes
ZEO_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRETS=/path/to/client_secrets.json \
    python examples/calendar_usage.py                 # live: opens a browser
```

Without the file: prints a skip notice plus the calling shapes for
`list_calendars`, `list_events`, `create_event`, `update_event`, and
`delete_event`. With it: runs the interactive OAuth consent flow in your
browser on first run (caching credentials into `./tmp_calendar_example/`),
lists calendars and upcoming events, then creates, updates, and **deletes** a
demo event dated 2099 — it cleans up after itself.

"Offline: yes" means the script does its real work with no network access.
"Skips" means it runs and prints a skip notice, but needs credentials (and a
network) to do anything interesting.
